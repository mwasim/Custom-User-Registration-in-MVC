The project adds the following additional fields on user registration page,

1.	First Name
2.	Last Name
3.	User Type (Buyer, Seller)

Each registered should have first name, and last name. And on registration, the user can select only one of the user types (roles) e.g. user can be either Buyer or a Seller.
